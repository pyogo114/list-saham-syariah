############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt



#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
def deal_card():
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    return random.choice(cards)

# Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
# and returns the score. 
# Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

# Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) 
# and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

# Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, 
# remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

# Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's 
# score is over 21, then the game ends.


def calculate_score(cardlist):
    
    total = sum(cardlist)
        
    if total > 21:
        
        i = 0

        for i in cardlist:
            if i == 11: # Kalau list maka i adalah valuenya, bukan key
                cardlist.remove(11)
                cardlist.append(1)
                return sum(cardlist)
    
    if total == 21:
        return 0

    return total

# Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. 
# If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has 
# a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. 
# If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then 
# the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

    yn = input("Will you take another card? ('y' or 'n')")

# Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, 
# clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
